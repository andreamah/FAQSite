					<h2>who invented the waffle?</h2>
					<p>Liege waffles, the most popular contemporary Belgian waffle variety, are rumored to have been invented during the 18th century, as well, by the chef to the prince-bishop of Liege.</p>
					<h2>who was the first scientist to propose that the universe is expanding?" </h2>
					<p>Edwin Hubble published a velocity-distance relation that strongly supported an expanding universe and, consequently, the Big Bang theory.</p>

					<h2>What is OK short for?</h2>
					<p><span style="color:#fff;background-color:#888">The most popular theory is that OK comes from 'oll korrect', a deliberately misspelled writing of 'all correct'. It was popularised in Boston newspapers around the 1840s when it was fashionable to go around spelling things incorrectly for humorous effect. Legend also has it that New York Democrats later adopted the abbreviation to promote their candidate Martin Van Buren - the initials 'OK' were derived from his nickname, Old Kinderhook.</span></p>
					<h2>What is a hiccup?</h2>
					<p><span style="color:#fff;background-color:#888">A hiccup comes from an involuntary contraction of the diaphragm, producing asudden intake of air. The glottis (the vocal apparatus of the larynx) slams shut at the same time, so that the column of air strikes the closed glottis to produce the characteristic, onomatopoeic noise.</span></p>
					<h2>What if Earth were twice as big?</h2>
					<p><span style="color:#fff;background-color:#888">If Earth's diameter were doubled to about 16,000 miles, the planet's mass would increase eight times, and the force of gravity on the planet would be twice as strong. All the plants and animals that currently exist would collapse under their own doubled weight, and new, stockier species would arise.</span></p>

					<h2>Where do phobias come from?</h2>
					<p>Around 10 per cent of the population suffer from phobias. Some may be triggered by a traumatic event while others are linked to physical problems. Studies suggest that simple phobias are partly genetic while others may be due to cultural history. For example, a fear of spiders may be passed down from the Middle Ages when spiders were associated with the plague, as victims' deserted homes became shrouded in cobwebs.</p>
					<h2>Where is the safest place to stand outside in a thunderstorm?</h2>
					<p>Tall, pointy objects standing alone in an open space are more likely to get struck by lightning but it's by no means a certainty. Sometimes the flat ground next to a tall tree can be hit. A car or other enclosed metal structure is the safest place to be in a thunderstorm. Failing that, a ditch, trench or group of shrubs of uniform height is better than nothing. Keep away from boundary areas between dissimilar terrain (water and land; rock and earth; trees and fields). Also keep at least five metres away from metal objects or other people as lightning will often jump from one object to another.</p>

					<h2>When will the universe end?</h2>
					<p><span style="color:#fff;background-color:#888">One theory of how the universe could potentially end relies on the assumption that the expansion of the universe will continue indefinitely until the galaxies, stars, planets, and matter (potentially even the subatomic building blocks that comprise all matter) can no longer hold themselves together; so they rip apart.</span></p>
					<h2>When do humans stop growing?</h2>
					<p><span style="color:#fff;background-color:#888">This usually happens at the average age of 16 years for girls and 18 years for boys. As for me, I don't think I was ever growing ^^; </span></p>
					<h2>when was the first traffic light installed?</h2>
					<p><span style="color:#fff;background-color:#888">The first electric traffic light was developed in 1912 by Lester Wire, a policeman in Salt Lake City, Utah, who also used red-green lights. On 5 August 1914, the American Traffic Signal Company installed a traffic signal system on the corner of East 105th Street and Euclid Avenue in Cleveland, Ohio.</span></p>

					<h2>Why do identical twins have different fingerprints?</h2>
					<p>
						Although identical twins share the same DNA, they don't look identical cell-for-cell, because not every aspect of your physical appearance is rigidly determined by your genes. Fingerprints are formed semi-randomly as the foetus develops in the womb andare affected by such things as chance fluctuations of hormone levels. Similarly, the pattern of freckles and moles on the skin is caused by random mutations and will vary between identical twins.
					</p>
					<h2>Why do fingers and toes wrinkle when left in water?</h2>
					<p>The waterproof coating on our skin gets rubbed away from areas of our bodies like our hands and feet that are frequently in contact with objects. If you immerse yourself in water with a lower concentration of dissolved salts than that of your cell contents, water will be absorbed by osmosis and cause your skin cells to swell. Since they are anchored to the tissues below, they are forced to corrugate to accommodate this.</p>
					<h2>Why can't we just fill in the ozone hole with man-made ozone?</h2>
					<p>The sheer scale of the notorious hole - or, more accurately, depleted region - in the Earth's ozone layer over the Antarctic beggars belief. At its peak each September, it spans an area bigger than the continental United States, and tens of millions of tonnes of ozone would be needed to fill it up again. Simply creating that amount of ozone, let alone getting it where it's needed, would be astronomically expensive.</p>
